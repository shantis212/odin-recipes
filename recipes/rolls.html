        <h5>A classic crowd pleaser and America's most popular dinner roll, these are also perfect for sandwiches with leftovers.</h5>
        <p>Having worked in many hotels and banquet facilities, I saw my fair share of Parker House rolls, and by "fair share," I mean they were almost literally on every menu, which is why I've never been very excited by these ubiquitous buns. Sure, they're buttery, tender, and delicious, but they are just so common, whenever I'd get a request to film them, I'd consider it briefly, and then move on to something more "exciting."</p>
        <p>That's a pretty lame excuse for not showing what is probably America's most popular dinner roll, so if you've been waiting, you have my sincerest apologies, and I hope it was worth the wait. By the way, this video's main goal is to show you how to make the dough, which can then be formed into hundreds of different shapes and designs. I went with the very simple fold-over method, since as I explained in the video, I do enjoy making adorable little sandwiches with the leftovers, but I encourage you to do an image search to see the possibilities.</p>
        <p>Besides customizing the shape, you can add things like garlic and/or herbs to the dough, depending on the meat pairing, as well as decorate the tops with sesame or poppy seeds. No matter what you do, just don't be shy with the butter, and you'll be enjoying a truly great, American dinner roll, which is why I really hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup war water</li>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine warm milk, warm water, and dry yeast in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer . Let sit for 10 minutes. Add eggs, sugar, salt, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Whisk all wet ingredients together. Add all purpose flour and knead with the dough hook (or manually) until dough comes together as a ball, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let sit until the dough is doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Press the dough until it is flat, and divide into 24 equal portions. Form each portion into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a Silpat mat or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Take each ball of dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface into an oval, 4 to 5 inches long. Brush the top with some of the remaining butter and fold in half.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolls to the prepared baking sheet, arranging in 6 rows of 4 rolls. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees C (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>While rolls are still warm, brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter.</li>
        </ol>
